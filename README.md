# Sepsis Prediction 
Sepsis is a life-threatening medical condition characterized by a systemic inflammatory response to infection, leading to organ dysfunction and failure.

The project aims to predict sepsis by utilizing a predictive model that takes into account various input features, including Plasma glucose level, Blood Work Result-1, Blood Pressure, Blood Work Result-2, Blood Work Result-3, Body mass index, Blood Work Result-4, Patient's age, and the presence of insurance. The goal is to develop a comprehensive prediction system for identifying sepsis risk in patients based on these key input variables.

## 1. Business Understanding

The primary objective of this project is to develop a predictive model for sepsis detection in patients within the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Sepsis is a life-threatening condition, and early detection is crucial for timely intervention and improved patient outcomes. The business goal is to enhance patient care by providing healthcare professionals with a tool that can assess the likelihood of sepsis development based on key clinical indicators.  

The model will utilize input features such as Plasma glucose level, Blood Work Results, Blood Pressure, Body mass index, Patient's age, and insurance status. The predictions generated by the model will assist healthcare providers in identifying patients at a higher risk of developing sepsis, enabling prompt and targeted medical interventions.

By implementing this predictive model, the healthcare system aims to achieve the following objectives:

1) Early Intervention: Enable healthcare professionals to intervene early in cases with a high predicted risk of sepsis, leading to timely and appropriate medical care.
2) Resource Optimization: Efficiently allocate medical resources by focusing attention on patients identified as high-risk, potentially reducing the overall burden on healthcare facilities.
3) Improved Patient Outcomes: Contribute to better patient outcomes by preventing or minimizing the severity of sepsis through proactive medical management.
