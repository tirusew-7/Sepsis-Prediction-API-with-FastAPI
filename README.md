# Sepsis Prediction 
Sepsis is a life-threatening medical condition characterized by a systemic inflammatory response to infection, leading to organ dysfunction and failure.

The project aims to predict sepsis by utilizing a predictive model that takes into account various input features, including Plasma glucose level, Blood Work Result-1, Blood Pressure, Blood Work Result-2, Blood Work Result-3, Body mass index, Blood Work Result-4, Patient's age, and the presence of insurance. The goal is to develop a comprehensive prediction system for identifying sepsis risk in patients based on these key input variables.

## 1. Business Understanding

The primary objective of this project is to develop a predictive model for sepsis detection in patients within the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Sepsis is a life-threatening condition, and early detection is crucial for timely intervention and improved patient outcomes. The business goal is to enhance patient care by providing healthcare professionals with a tool that can assess the likelihood of sepsis development based on key clinical indicators.  

The model will utilize input features such as Plasma glucose level, Blood Work Results, Blood Pressure, Body mass index, Patient's age, and insurance status. The predictions generated by the model will assist healthcare providers in identifying patients at a higher risk of developing sepsis, enabling prompt and targeted medical interventions.

By implementing this predictive model, the healthcare system aims to achieve the following objectives:

1) Early Intervention: Enable healthcare professionals to intervene early in cases with a high predicted risk of sepsis, leading to timely and appropriate medical care.
2) Resource Optimization: Efficiently allocate medical resources by focusing attention on patients identified as high-risk, potentially reducing the overall burden on healthcare facilities.
3) Improved Patient Outcomes: Contribute to better patient outcomes by preventing or minimizing the severity of sepsis through proactive medical management.

#### More on Variables

The features (independent variables) in this dataset describe various physiological and clinical measurements of patients in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), as well as demographic information. Here's an explanation of each feature:

PRG (Attribute1 - Plasma glucose level): This feature represents the level of glucose in the patient's plasma. Glucose levels are often monitored in medical settings as they can indicate conditions such as diabetes or stress response.

PL (Attribute 2 - Blood Work Result-1 in mu U/ml): This feature likely represents the results of a specific blood test, measured in milliunits per milliliter (mu U/ml).

PR (Attribute 3 - Blood Pressure in mm Hg): This feature represents the patient's blood pressure, measured in millimeters of mercury (mm Hg). Blood pressure is a crucial indicator of cardiovascular health and can help identify conditions such as hypertension or hypotension.

SK (Attribute 4 - Blood Work Result-2 in mm): Similar to Attribute 2, this likely represents another blood test result, but the specific test is not specified. It is measured in millimeters (mm).

TS (Attribute 5 - Blood Work Result-3 in mu U/ml): Another blood test result, measured in milliunits per milliliter (mu U/ml).

M11 (Attribute 6 - Body mass index): This feature represents the patient's body mass index (BMI), calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters. BMI is commonly used to assess whether a person has a healthy body weight relative to their height.

BD2 (Attribute 7 - Blood Work Result-4 in mu U/ml): Yet another blood test result, measured in milliunits per milliliter (mu U/ml).

Age (Attribute 8 - Patient's age in years): This feature indicates the age of the patient in years. Age can be an important factor in assessing overall health and susceptibility to certain conditions.

Insurance (N/A - Binary variable indicating whether a patient holds a valid insurance card): This binary variable indicates whether the patient holds a valid insurance card, which may be relevant for healthcare access and coverage.

The target variable, labeled "Sepsis," indicates whether a patient in the ICU will develop sepsis or not. Sepsis is a severe medical condition caused by the body's overwhelming response to an infection. It can lead to tissue damage, organ failure, and death if not treated promptly. The target variable is binary, with "Positive" indicating the patient will develop sepsis and "Negative" indicating they will not. Predicting sepsis development is crucial for timely intervention and improving patient outcomes in the ICU.
